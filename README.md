A modern, vibrant, and responsive landing page for **MSquare Groups**, featuring a custom "Prismatic Light" design system. This project showcases a clean, professional aesthetic with playful colorful accents and advanced CSS glassmorphism effects.

## 🎨 Design System: "Prismatic Light"

The UI has been completely revamped to move away from dark, heavy themes to a fresh, energetic look:
- **Vibrant Palette**: Clean white backgrounds (`#ffffff`) accented with bright Royal Blue, Violet, and Emerald gradients.
- **Glassmorphism**: "Frosted White" glass effects on cards and forms, creating depth and a premium feel.
- **Aurora Backgrounds**: Subtle, animated colorful blobs that float in the background, adding life to the page without distracting content.
- **Modern Typography**: High-contrast dark text using the `Inter` font family for maximum readability.

## ✨ Key Features

- **Dynamic Hero Section**: Features an animated aurora background and a clear call-to-action.
- **Interactive Cards**: Services and Testimonials use glassmorphism with hover effects that lift and glow.
- **Responsive Layout**: Fully optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop screens.
